```ts
type TopicFilter: (null | string | string[])[];
```

A **TopicFilter** provides a struture to define bloom-filter queries.

Each field that is `null` matches **any** value, a field that is a `string` must match exactly that value and and
`array` is effectively an `OR`-ed set, where any one of those values must match.
