```ts
type BlockTag: BigNumberish | string;
```

A **BlockTag** specifies a specific block.

**numeric value** - specifies the block height, where the genesis block is block 0; many operations accept a negative
value which indicates the block number should be deducted from the most recent block. A numeric value may be a
`number`, `bigint`, or a decimal of hex string.

**blockhash** - specifies a specific block by its blockhash; this allows potentially orphaned blocks to be specifed,
without ambiguity, but many backends do not support this for some operations.
