The Qi ledger is a UTXO-based transactional system designed to function as digital cash. By focusing solely on transactions with fixed denominations, the Qi ledger enhances fungibility and mirrors the characteristics of traditional cash.

## The Qi Token

### Fixed Denomination Structure

Qi’s UTXO ledger utilizes fixed denominations, similar to traditional cash equivalents such as quarters, dimes, and dollars. This approach increases fungibility, ensuring Qi is more straightforward and consistent, akin to digital cash.

### Enhanced Fungibility

The fixed denominations in Qi’s design address common fungibility limitations found in other UTXO-based systems like Bitcoin. This design is intended to facilitate a smooth user experience, aligning with common cash handling practices and promoting intuitive use for payments. With a focus on homogeneity, Qi can function more effectively as a digital cash equivalent, reducing transaction friction and increasing usability.

## Payment Focused Design

Qi is designed solely for transactions and payments, and does not support any form of scripting. This restriction further enhances the fungibility of Qi and underscores its primary focus on facilitating payments. By eliminating unnecessary complexity and optimizing for fungibility, Qi enables efficient, consistent digital payments aligned with real-world cash transactions.
